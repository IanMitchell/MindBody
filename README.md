# Mindbody Hackathon

This application was developed as part of the [Mindbody Hackathon](https://www.facebook.com/events/542057222532981/). We were given 20 hours to develop an application that focused on health, UX, or the local area. It was developed by myself and Elaine Lau, and took 1st place in UX.

Our concept was to create a Pinterest style website, where users could upload pictures (and attach a corresponding link) of local areas. It features tagging, and autocompletion when searching / adding a new location. We used a variety of third party frameworks and libraries to achieve our goal.

Please keep in mind that due to the 20 hour time limit, the code isn't as clean as we'd like. If you'd like to get a copy up and running, you'll need to have an installation of ElasticSearch.
